✨ *You can call me __Kumi__ or __Yue__*

🤭 *I'm a big hololive fan!! Usually I'm not really verbal n'tend to just quietly be on my own. Not that I'm always grumpy or anything

📌 *You're free to interact with me, I like anything!!I don't really have specific interests but I'm really hyper-fixated in Hololive, feel free to have silly talks with me, I don't bite! Just be mindful of what you say and don't be a jerk.*

### BYI & Silly stuff!! 
📜 *Before you interact... please keep in mind the following!!*
- Very silly n'chill person to be around, doesn't mean I'll sugarcoat stuff or be doing blind eye to wrong stuff though.
- My social battery drains really fast, so be a little patient with me!
- I do not do roleplay and I absolutely despise it, it's not because I'm cosplaying a certain character that it means I'm acting like them, so please don't.
- I can and will hide you if I feel bothered, be mindful and please watch out of what you're saying.
- You're more granted to get a reply if you whisper me!
- You can check more in my pronouns.cc or carrd, it's not a lot!
